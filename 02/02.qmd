## RStudio

RStudio comprises four main regions in its main window (which can be customized in the settings):

- The *Console* in the bottom left corner.
- The *Editor* in the top left corner (only if you have opened one or more files).
- The *Environment* and *History* tabs in the top right corner.
- The *Files*, *Plots*, *Packages*, and *Help*  tabs in the lower right corner.

![](rstudio.png)

We have already used the R console – that's where R is lurking in the background waiting for our commands. We will soon see that we can collect and store R commands in a so-called *R script* (a text file). That's when we need the editor part in RStudio. We will also talk about the other components – let's start with package management (make sure to switch to the *Packages* tab in the lower right pane).


## Packages

Packages extend the functionality of R, which ships only with a basic set of core features. As soon as you need to do something that is not included in base R, you will need to install a third-party package. Fortunately, this process is pretty straightforward. Almost all additional packages are available in the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/). Exactly two steps are required to use a third-party package:

1. Install the package (just once)
2. Activate the package (before you can use it in the current R session)

Before we discuss each step in detail, let's step back a bit. Sometimes it can be a challenge to find the right package to install. After all, if you don't know the package name, you cannot install it. Querying a search engine usually leads to the right package (for example, if you are looking for a package that provides linear mixed models, the search "R linear mixed models" lists the `lme4` package among the first results, which is probably the most popular R package for these specific models). In addition, the [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) provide a nice overview of a broad range of topics with relevant R packages.

Let's now learn how to *install* an R package given that we know its name. After that, we will learn how to *activate* a package in the current R session.


### Package management in RStudio

RStudio lists all installed packages in the *Packages* tab in the lower right region of the window. Each row contains the name, a short description, and the version of a package. In addition, there are also icons/links that let you browse the package website as well as uninstall the package if you don't need it anymore.

Clicking on "Install" pops up a dialog window which lets you install a package from CRAN – all you need to do is enter the package name. Similarly, clicking on "Update" lets you update one or more (or even all) installed packages.

:::{.callout-tip}
It is generally a good idea to keep your packages up to date, so make sure to check for package updates regularly.
:::

In case you want to get rid of an installed package, you can click on the tiny gray "X" icon in the rightmost column of a package.

The checkboxes to the left of each package indicate if a package is activated or not. Some core packages (such as `base` or `datasets`) are activated by default, but most additional packages are inactive. To activate or deactivate a package, simply click on the corresponding checkbox.


### Package management with R commands

Under the hood, RStudio uses R commands to perform package management tasks. Therefore, you can install and activate packages directly from the console.

Here's how to get a list of all installed packages (this list corresponds to the list in the *Packages* tab in RStudio):

```r
library()
```

Similarly, the following command lists all activated packages:

```r
search()
```

If you want to install a new package (e.g. `psych`), you can type:

```r
install.packages("psych")
```

Note that the package name must be enclosed in (single or double) quotes.

Finally, here's the most important command that you will use over and over in your code. Activating a package (e.g. `psych`) is as simple as running the following command:

```r
library(psych)
```

In this case, the package name does not have to be in quotes.


## The R programming language

### Scripts

Running R commands in the console is very convenient for exploring data and trying out different things interactively. This process is called the [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop), because the console **r**eads a command, **e**valuates it, and **p**rints the result – these steps repeat in a **l**oop over and over again.

However, such interactive data exploration eventually leads to a series of commands that need to be stored permanently – that's where scripts come in handy. An R script is a simple plaintext file (with file extension `.R`) consisting of R commands. Usually, each line of the script contains exactly one command. RStudio can load, edit, save, and run R scripts with its built-in editor.

A script implements a reproducible analysis pipeline. This means that you can exactly reproduce all results when running the whole script (from top to bottom, line by line) in a pristine R session, even on a different computer. Therefore, reproducing an analysis entails loading a script and running all lines sequentially – the "Source" button (or the related "Source with echo" button) in the editor toolbar does exactly that.

In addition, you might also want to run only certain lines of the script to execute or repeat only parts of an analysis. Clicking on the "Run" button runs the current line or all selected lines.

![](rstudio_run_code.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
Running the current line or the currently selected lines in the console is much faster when you use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> on macOS.
:::

If a script uses functions from packages, it is necessary to activate all corresponding packages (ideally at the very beginning of the script). Remember that `library(package)` activates a package (named `package` in this example).

:::{.callout-important}
Never include `install.packages("package")` in your script, because you do not want to install the package every time you run the script! Instead, manually install all required packages either in the Package tab in RStudio or from the console.
:::

One final note for Windows users: Make sure to select UTF-8 as the default encoding for scripts (macOS and Linux already use this encoding by default). Open the RStudio preferences, navigate to "Code" – "Saving", and select UTF-8 in the field "Default text encoding" (by clicking on "Change..."):

![](encoding.png)


### Working directory

An R session operates and works in a specific directory on your computer – the so-called *working directory*. The following command prints the current working directory:

```r
getwd()
```

:::{.callout-tip}
RStudio also shows the current working directory right below the console title (usually, this is `~/` initially, which is shorthand for your home directory).
:::

The contents of the working directory (files and subdirectories) is shown in the *Files* tab in the lower right part of RStudio. Alternatively, the `dir()` command also lists the working directory contents in the console.

The working directory enables R to load data by specifying only the file name or a relative path (instead of the full absolute path). Therefore, it is good practice to put scripts and data files into a common directory tree and set the working directory to point to this location before running the script.

The command `setwd("path/to/working/directory")` sets the working directory to the path specified in quotes (in this example, the new working directory would be `path/to/working/directory`)[^1]. Alternatively, RStudio offers three shortcuts to set the working directory:

[^1]: Note that paths should always use slashes `/` as separators, even on Windows (which normally uses backslashes `\`).

1. Use the "Session" – "Set Working Directory" menu entry (and then any of the three options).
2. Navigate to the desired directory in the *Files* pane and click on "More" – "Set As Working Directory".
3. In the editor, right-click on the name tab of an open script and select "Set Working Directory".

In summary, it is important to set the working directory to the desired location before sourcing an R script. In addition, do not include any `setwd` commands in your script, because this prevents other people from running the script (mainly because in general they will not have the same directories on their computers that you have). It is the user's responsibility to set the working directory correctly before running a script.


### Workspace or environment

All manually created objects such as data and variables (more on that later) in the current R session are called *workspace* or *environment*. The following command lists all objects in the current environment:

```r
ls()
```

RStudio has a dedicated *Environment* pane (top right) that makes it easy to constantly monitor the workspace.


### Syntax

Let's take a closer look at the following example script:

```r
# compute sum of integers from 1 to 100
n = 100
x = 1:n
sum(x)
n * (n + 1) / 2  # closed-form solution for sum(x)
```

This example demonstrates the basic R syntax (language rules). First of all, there is typically one command per line (although that isn't strictly necessary, but it is strongly recommended because it increases code readability).


#### Comments

R ignores everything after a `#` character (until the end of the line). This is how we write *comments* to explain our code. Do not underestimate the importance of comments – they exist to help you (or other people) understand the code long after you've written it. If nothing else, write comments for your future self! Note that good comments explain the *why* and not the *how* (the latter should be clear by reading the code).


#### Variables and objects

We can assign values to variables with the assignment operator `=`, for example `n = 100` assigns the value (also called object) `100` to the variable `n`. A variable is a name (an alias, a placeholder) for an object, similar to variables in mathematics. Once a variable is defined (assigned), it appears in the environment. We can inspect the contents of a variable by simply typing its name in the console. In the example, we defined two variables `n` and `x`.

:::{.callout-note}
In addition to `=`, R has another operator for assignment written as `<-`. Both operators are exactly the same, and I recommend using `=` because this makes your code easier to read. However, many people prefer `<-`, so you will likely see this operator in other people's code.
:::

Variable names are case-sensitive (so `n` is different from `N`). Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dots (most people avoid dots though).


#### Functions

Informally, a *function* is a "mini" script that we can run by *calling* the function. In our example, we call the function `sum` using `sum(x)`.

A function call consists of the function name and a pair of parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses, we can provide *arguments* – additional information that the function needs to work properly. In the function call `sum(x)`, we pass exactly one argument (the variable `x`, which contains a bunch of numbers that the function sums up). Note that even if you do not supply any arguments, you still need to include the parentheses. Functions that work without arguments include `getwd()`, `library()`, and `ls()`. Some functions also take multiple arguments, for example the function call `sum(1, 2, 3)` has three arguments (separated by commas).

Importantly, functions can also return a value (the result). For instance, calling `sum(1, 2, 3)` returns the value `6` as its result.

:::{.callout-note}
From now on, we write function names with `()` to make it clear that the name refers to a function. For example, `mean()` is a function which computes the arithmetic mean of some numbers that have to be passed as an argument.
:::

Almost all R commands are expressions involving function calls, variables, and operators, so it is very helpful to remember these basic building blocks. Put even simpler (from [John M. Chambers, Extending R, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2016](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781315381305/extending-john-chambers)):

- Everything that *exists* in R is an *object*.
- Everything that *happens* in R is a *function call*.


### Documentation

R comes with extensive integrated documentation (which is also available offline). RStudio displays documentation in the *Help* panel (lower right). There are two options to get help for a specific R command directly in the R console (the following example demonstrates this for the `sum()` function):

```r
help(sum)
?sum
```


#### Example 1

Let's inspect the documentation for `sum()` more closely, because all help pages are organized in a similar way. It is a good habit to quickly skim the help text for every new function that you are about to use for the first time – this will get you started much quicker than just assuming things (that might not be true) or filling in arguments by trial and error.

The very first line contains the name of the function and the package it comes from in curly braces:

```
sum {base}
```

We now know that the `sum()` function is contained in the `base` package.

Next, the title summarizes the purpose of the function:

```
Sum of Vector Elements
```

The "Description" section contains a slightly more detailed summary of what the function is all about.

"Usage" describes how to call the function:

```
sum(..., ra.rm = FALSE)
```

We already know that we have to write the function name followed by a pair of parentheses. In addition, this section also tells us which *arguments* we can (and must) pass – in this case, there are two possible arguments (`...` and `na.rm`). The second argument `na.rm` has a default value of `FALSE`, which means that if we do not pass a second argument in our function call, `na.rm` automatically gets its default value of `FALSE`.

More details on each argument are listed in the subsequent "Arguments" section. In this example, we learn that `...` should be "numeric or complex or logical vectors" (we'll learn about vectors soon).

The next section contains a detailed description of the function. If you want to understand what is going on when you call the function, you need to read this section carefully.

The "Value" section tells us what the function returns (what it computes). Often, the help text includes some useful references such as books or articles. Many functions also include a "See Also" section, which lists similar and related functions.

Last but definitely not least, most help pages contain several usage examples. You can copy and paste them into the console to try them out and see the examples in action.


#### Example 2

Let's take a look at another help page, this time we'll view the documentation of `mean()`:

```r
?mean
```

We learn that this function computes the arithmetic mean, and we can use it like this:

```
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
```

The first parameter `x` is a (numeric) vector containing the numbers we want to average. We must always provide this argument when calling the function, because it has no default value. The next two parameters (`trim` and `na.rm`) both have default values, so we don't need to specify values if we are happy with the defaults. The fourth parameter `...` summarizes "further arguments" that are not really explained.

:::{.callout-note}
Function parameters and arguments are often used synonymously, but there is a difference: a *parameter* is formally defined in the function header, and when we *call* a function, we pass *arguments* that replace parameters with *specific values*.

For example, the `mean()` function has several parameters, and the first parameter is called `x`. When we call the function using `mean(1:10)`, we pass the argument `1:10`, which is used instead of `x` everywhere inside the function to compute the mean. You can think of parameters as *placeholders* and arguments as the *actual values* that replace these placeholders when calling a function.
:::

Let's try some examples to see the different ways we can call the `mean()` function. Let's assume we have a numeric vector (a collection of numbers, more on that in the next chapter) stored in the variable `numbers`:

```{r}
numbers = c(1, 8, 17, -6, 5.5, -12.2)
```

We can compute the arithmetic mean like this:

```{r}
mean(numbers)
```

Optionally, we can explicitly name arguments in our function call. The first parameter is called `x`, so we could write:

```{r}
mean(x=numbers)
```

The same is true for the other arguments; we can either pass values by position or by name:

```{r}
mean(numbers, trim=0.25)
mean(numbers, 0.25)
mean(x=numbers, trim=0.25)
mean(x=numbers, 0.25)
mean(trim=0.25, x=numbers)
```

## Exercises

1. Install the packages `readr`, `Hmisc`, and `psych` – try using both the RStudio GUI and R commands! Determine the versions of each package. How can you uninstall/remove a package?

2. Read the documentation for the `help()` function (two options)!

3. Read the documentation for the `+` operator! Note that you need to enclose operators with backticks, i.e. `` `+` ``.

4. Create a script called `my_first_script.R`. Add the following elements to your script:

   - A comment containing the text "Exercise 3"
   - Activate the package `psych`
   - Compute the mean of the numbers 45, 66, 37, 54, 17, and 22. Assign the result to the variable `m` – use only basic arithmetic operations (and not the function `mean()`)!

   Feel free to insert empty lines to make your script easy to read!

5. Let's assume we want to calculate the arithmetic mean of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Having already learned about `mean()`, we want to put our knowledge to use, so we call the function as follows:

   ```r
   mean(1, 2, 3)
   ```

   What's wrong with the function call (the arithmetic mean should be 2)?

6. Read the documentation of `sum()` to answer the following questions:

   - How many required arguments to we need to pass when calling the function?
   - How many optional arguments does the function have?
   - What does the function call `sum()` (no arguments) do (compare with the function call `mean()`)?
